This is the readme for A7

So for this project, I am going to implement classes:

BinaryRV.java
NaiveBayesClassifier.java
Query.java
TestData.java

TestData 
	- takes the test.data file and stores it

NaiveBayesClassifier.java
	- this takes Training.data and creates a model so we can classify queries in TestData.java with its probability

Query.java
	the query represntation of the information inside TestData

TestData.java
